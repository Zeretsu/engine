# Advanced Electric Motor Simulator

## Description

This project is an interactive web-based simulation of an electric motor. It provides a visual representation of a motor's operation, allowing users to adjust voltage and load while observing real-time changes in RPM, current, temperature, and efficiency.

## Features

- Interactive motor visualization with rotating rotor
- Adjustable voltage and load
- Real-time displays of RPM, current, temperature, and efficiency
- Efficiency bar for visual feedback
- Overheating protection simulation
- Sound effects that change based on motor speed
- Starry background animation
- Tooltips for educational information

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Web Audio API

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Zeretsu/advanced-electric-motor-simulator.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd advanced-electric-motor-simulator
3. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

## Usage

- Use the voltage slider to adjust the input voltage to the motor.
- Use the load slider to simulate mechanical load on the motor.
- Click the "Start Motor" button to begin the simulation.
- Observe changes in RPM, current, temperature, and efficiency as you adjust the controls.
- Hover over different elements to view educational tooltips.

## Audio

The simulation includes audio feedback. Ensure you have the `engine-rpm.mp3` file in the same directory as the HTML file for the sound to work properly.
